# DestroyerFarewellCard

## Steps

- Create a new class that implements the `AbstractCard` Class. Name the class `YOUR_NAMECard`.
- Implement the methods for your new class
- If you are adding an image, add it to the Images folder and make sure that the image has been set to `copy to output`.
- Your class will automatically be picked up and displayed with all the other classes, so there is no coding required other than on your own class.
- Create a pull request into the master branch or send me the class and I'll add it for you.
